# edu_quest_post_type request handling plugin

This plugin implements the post request handling that comes from submitting the filter form terms in the [questionary page](https://edu.ellak.gr/edu_quest_post_type)

Uses the * Wordpress way * of handling the post requests which means it hooks on the admin_post and the admin_post_nopriv actions to execute.
